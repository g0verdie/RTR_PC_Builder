base case for the gaming rig ($800) - medium everything with a bit more given to storage.
base case for casual ($500) - minimum graphics, mostly CPU, and a bit on storage (at least 256Gb SSD).
base case for professional ($1600) - most of the money going into CPU and Graphics. Requires an SSD.
RAM? Minimum specs. Base case is 4Gb for casual. 8GB for gaming (if >$1200, make it 16). 16Gb for professional.

Newegg API has Java/PHP/C#/Python implementation, but we can always pipe the result JSON to Ruby/anything else.
