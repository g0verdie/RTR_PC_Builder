Let's talk more about project design. Also, Feroz is a fuck for not showing up on time ever.
Brandon is going to spend one hours, two hours max on the website wireframe.

Design:
For the size selection page, have the pictures of different form factors shown on the screen with a little description for each. When a user hovers cursor over any of them, the corresponding comparison chart should light up to visually show the customer the relative size of his computer.
